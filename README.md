Testing basically

What I am doing is creating a program to automatically convert from equirectangular projection to mercator projection.

Here is the plan of action for the creation of this program

> Get image                                                 /\\
> Split image                                               /\\
> Put the split images into a new file                      /\\
> Name the images according to their latitude               /\\
> Stretch the image by the function of its file name 
    > Stretching function
    > Stretching number function
    > Replace the thing with it's name
> combine the images                                        /\\
> delete the folder                                         /\\

> add more functionality for negative latitudes
